# DNS Blacklist Attack Simulation

## Overview:
This project demonstrates how **DNS blacklisting** can be used to identify malicious or suspicious IP addresses. The script compares a list of IP addresses to known blacklisted IPs and outputs whether each IP is blacklisted or not.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to simulate a **DNS blacklist attack**. The Python script (`dns_blacklist.py`) checks the IPs in the provided directory against a blacklist of known malicious IPs, simulating the detection of harmful traffic using DNS filtering.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used for creating the script.
- **DNS Blacklist**: Concept of blocking or flagging IPs/domains as malicious.
- **Terminal/Command Line**: Used to run the script and view outputs.
